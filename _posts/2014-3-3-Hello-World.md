title: IIT Kanpur MS Interview Experience - CSE
---

Hello folks, I gave GATE CSE - 2019, and would like to share my interview experience at IIT Kanpur with u all..
Well, rather than telling what to DO, here I would be telling more on what NOT TO DO in interviews.

9 May 2019
Gate score - 762, AIR- 388, Category - General

IIT Kanpur had shared a google doc well before the interview dates in which we had to choose area of our interest. Written test and interview would then be in that chosen area only. They had 2 groups to choose from:
Theory+ Data science And Systems, Syllabus for written test, Sample written test PDF.
