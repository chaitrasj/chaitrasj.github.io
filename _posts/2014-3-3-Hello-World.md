title: IIT Kanpur MS Interview Experience - CSE
---

Hello folks, I gave GATE CSE - 2019, and would like to share my interview experience at IIT Kanpur with u all..
Well, rather than telling what to DO, here I would be telling more on what NOT TO DO in interviews.

9 May 2019
Gate score - 762, AIR- 388, Category - General

IIT Kanpur had shared a google doc well before the interview dates in which we had to choose area of our interest. Written test and interview would then be in that chosen area only. They had 2 groups to choose from:
Theory+ Data science And Systems, Syllabus for written test, Sample written test PDF.
Based on Written test and Programming test, candidates were shortlisted to be interviewed.
57 candidates were chosen for Systems and 27 for Theory. I had chosen Theory as my area. My interview began at around 3.30 pm, and I was the first one to be interviewed in Theory group for MS. The panel had 3 profs, Nitin Saxena (Interviewer 1), Piyush Rai (Interviewer 2), and I didn’t knew the 3rd prof.

Interviewer: Tell us something about yourself.
Me: Told about my B.Tech branch, University, Work experience and Gate score and Rank.

Interviewer: In what area you would like to do MS?
Me: (They had asked to attach SOP in our application form, in SOP I had written Deep learning as my interested area, so I thought maybe they would have SOP with them and I had somewhat prepared on that topic, so I said Deep learning, and that was the first biggest mistake I did! Also the panel had profs who were working on ML!)

Interviewer 1 : Tell me the formal definition of Deep learning
Me: I tried telling it from the application point of view, but they didn’t wanted that.

Interviewer 2 : Do you know about Neural Networks?
Me: Yes Sir, I have read about them.

Interviewer 2: Can you draw and explain on the board?
Me: I went to the board and drew a network with just 1 neuron, and explained that it took x as input, the neuron is the function which computes and gives y as it’s output.

Interviewer 2: Where have you learnt about Deep learning? Some online videos or some course or moocs?
Me: Sir, I had enrolled on a course in Coursera by Andrew Ng and I had seen some videos, but I have not done any assignments. (This was my second mistake, I shouldn’t have said about the course because I was not confident enough)

Interviewer 2: Does this neuron take x directly? Or something else?
Me: Yes Sir, I think takes x only.

Interviewer 2: Do we give something else with x in input?
Me: I was not getting what more is given, but after struggle for 2–3 minutes, with their hints, I said weights and biases are applied, I said yes linear function of x is given as input.

(Actually, x is multiplied with weights and added with biases, and this linear function of x is given to the neuron as input, but I didn’t knew it happens in all neural networks, and I took lot of time to answer this very basic question, so they had started getting pissed off.)
