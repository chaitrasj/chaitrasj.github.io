|                           Hello Friends, well let me introduce myself. I am an Electronics and Telecommunication engineer, born and brought up in Mumbai, India. I have an experience of working in an IT company for 1.5 yrs in Telecom domain. Since my school days I love learning and creating new things. I like to truly understand how something works rather than just settling for using the end product.|

|                           During my work at Wipro, I got inclined towards programming and Computer science areas. Owing to my interests in learning, I decided to go for Masters. So I left my job and with rigorous preparation of 1 year for GATE, I managed to bag in seat in the prestigious Institute, Indian Institute of Science. I will be joining IISc as a Research student in Computational and Data sciences department.|

|                           Apart from work life, most of my time is spent in sleeping, writing code for work and pleasure, lazing around, listening to music, thinking about interesting things, and consuming various media. My favorite things to think about recently include artificial intelligence and machine learning, deep learning and computer vision, mathematics, logic puzzles, and problem solving. I have lately started competitive programming.|

|                           I will speak about my love for my research and my journey so far, in my blog posts. I have a pretty sporadic online presence, you can email me, find me on Facebook or LinkedIn or Quora, or message me on Messenger.
